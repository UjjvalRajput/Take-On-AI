Analysis to answer the question: 
How does traditional and social media discourse differ in portraying AI and automation?

Data:
I analyzed the portrayal of AI in traditional and social media by collecting and
processing data from GitHub and The New York Times over the period of January 2021 to June
2024. For GitHub, I utilized GraphQL to fetch discussion posts from AI-focused repositories,
extracting approximately 1,100 posts and storing them in a JSON file for preprocessing, which
included punctuation removal, lowercase conversion, lemmatization, and stopword filtering.
Traditional media data consisted of 498 articles from The New York Times, accessed via its API
and processed similarly to ensure consistency. Both datasets underwent sentiment analysis using
the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer from the National Language Toolkit to quantify the emotional
tone of the texts. The processed data facilitated a comparative analysis of sentiment and the
frequency of AI-related discussions over the past year, providing a clear contrast in how each
platform discusses AI and automation.

Conclusion:
The data analysis from my study clearly shows that traditional media tends to offer balanced and
cautious portrayals of AI and automation, while social media favors sensationalism and polarized views.
These findings provide a quantitative backbone to discussions about how different media platforms 
influence public perceptions and discussions around emerging technologies.
