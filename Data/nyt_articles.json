Even those who don't design microcircuits or genetically manipulate bacteria will be working with computers or robots in their offices and factories. For a new type of automation is taking place, one that is expected to change the world employment picture dramatically.   Some workers will benefit from the new high-technology fields, such as computer science. Others will find their jobs eliminated in what some experts think will be widespread unemployment brought about by automation. There will be extensive retraining for entry into new fields or adapting to computers - which will become as commonplace as telephones. And job responsibilities and relations between employers and employees will shift dramatically as a result of high technology, a nebulous term that roughly includes those technical and scientific fields in which advances are occurring rapidly - such as computers and telecommunications, genetic engineering and the design of new materials.   According to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the most rapidly growing demand in the United States in the next decade will be for technicians for computer repair. Using what the bureau called assumptions of low growth in the economy, demand for such mechanics was still expected to increase 147 percent from 1978 to 1990, according to a recent bureau study.",

''When they said 'real things,' they meant computers that can play chess,'' said Dr. Roger Schank, chairman of the computer science department at Yale University. ''They were not going to talk to Wall Street, let alone own a suit.''   Now, however, business is taking an interest in artificial intelligence, or A.I., and some professors, such as Dr. Schank, are forming or joining companies to capitalize on the expected boom. But the new move toward commercialization is disrupting the academic community and provoking fears that university research will be hurt.",

''The raw signals measure physical phenomena. Inferences are then made from the physical phenomena in order to give clients answers. As a result of this information, we know where to drill, how much we'll get out of the ground and whether hydrocarbons are present.''   Artificial intelligence is the cutting edge of computer programming. A broad and term, it embraces a number of different types of software - some truly advanced and others not. It is also fast becoming one of the computer industry's most overused buzzwords, as if artificial intelligence was itelf a type of program. It is not.

Engineers are installing a factory communication system that should allow computers, process controllers, robots and other machines made by competing suppliers to communicate with each other.   The Pontiac communication system, which will connect 21 types of devices from 13 different vendors, is the most ambitious attempt yet to knit together what manufacturers call the ''islands of automation'' that have popped up wherever they have invested in computers and modern machinery. It also represents the first large-scale test on a factory floor for Manufacturing Automation Protocol, or MAP, a growing collection of rules and standards for electronic communication in the factory.   Without MAP or something like it, many of the potential benefits of automation are squandered. Manufacturers must customize existing communications systems, which is expensive and only partly effective, or assign human employees to run throughout plants transferring information between machines. That exchange of data could be done faultlessly in seconds if only there were standards for communications between machines from different manufacturers.",

Robot technology was born and bred in the United States during the 1950's and 1960's, and Americans are used to seeing photos of robots painting, welding and drilling everything from car bodies to dishwashers.

In the coming decade, a s companies in the United States forge ahead with computerized m anufacturing, the factory floor will take on ''Star Wars'' overtonesw ith batteries of robots, the so-called steel-collar workers, ' 'manning'' assembly lines.   But the labor-saving robot has also created a new, if streamlined, work force: its own technician specialty, capable of low-level programming and reprogramming, monitoring and occasionally repairing the robot's complex anatomy. As corps of robot engineers and computer-software programmers design subsequent generations of robots, these technicians at least for the foreseeable future will maintain the robots actually plugged into the restructured factory landscape.",

The automatic truck in the Honda Motor Company's sprawling manufacturing complex here does the same things a manned vehicle could do, but it quite possibly does them faster and with more adaptability. It is indicative, though, of this country's attitude toward automation, particularly in the automobile industry. The Japanese auto companies do not just use automation as a tool: They revel in it.   Engineers at auto plants here beam with pride as they show off engine production lines that process raw castings into finished parts, untouched by human hands. Automatic transfer arms, not people, stand between the machines in stamping lines, smoothly moving body panels hour after hour without faltering.",

Citing predictions that robot sales will rise 35 to 50 percent a year, Mr. Bentsen, the ranking Senate Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee, said millions of jobs, conceivably one-quarter of the nation's factory work force, could be lost to robots by 1990.   The Texas Senator, who presided over a brief hearing on the issue today, called for plans and training programs to cope with ''a revolution taking place in the work force.''",

Although automation would take away the jobs of hundreds of thousands of industrial and office workers, if not more, a failure to automate would almost certainly cause the loss of far more jobs to foreign competition, the panelists concluded.   And automation would at least partly offset the job losses by creating new jobs in the automation industries themselves and by lowering the prices of goods so that people would buy more and total production would rise, said Frank. P. Stafford, chairman of the economics department at the University of Michigan.   Indeed, automation might enable the currently depressed automobile and steel industries, often described as ''sunset industries,'' to compete more effectively against foreign competition than can the more ''high technology'' American electronics industry, Professor Stafford said.",

        "abstract": "  Although the International Business Machines Corporation prides itself on leading the way in the computer industry, it is following a path well trodden by others to enter the field of robotics.   The licensing agreement I.B.M. announced last week to use a robot designed by Sankyo Seiki, one of Japan's least-known and financially weaker robot manufacturers, recalls similar agreements that helped many companies get started in this business before they had a robot on hand.",

        "abstract": "  SOONER or later, many experts think, most of us will have careers that involve high technology. Even those who don't design microcircuits or genetically manipulate bacteria will be working with computers or robots in their offices and factories. For a new type of automation is taking place, one that is expected to change the world employment picture dramatically.   Some workers will benefit from the new high-technology fields, such as computer science. Others will find their jobs eliminated in what some experts think will be widespread unemployment brought about by automation. There will be extensive retraining for entry into new fields or adapting to computers - which will become as commonplace as telephones. And job responsibilities and relations between employers and employees will shift dramatically as a result of high technology, a nebulous term that roughly includes those technical and scientific fields in which advances are occurring rapidly - such as computers and telecommunications, genetic engineering and the design of new materials.   According to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the most rapidly growing demand in the United States in the next decade will be for technicians for computer repair. Using what the bureau called assumptions of low growth in the economy, demand for such mechanics was still expected to increase 147 percent from 1978 to 1990, according to a recent bureau study.",
